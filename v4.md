# miyagi v4

## General

- _miyagi_ is now an **ES module**.
- The minimum NodeJS version is now `20.11.0`.
- Lots of minor bug fixes.

## UI

- **The menu has dedicated sections for design tokes, components and documentation.**

  In the design tokens section, there are dedicated pages for colors, sizes and typography.

- **_miyagi_ is now using a presentation mode when creating a static build.**

  The presentation mode hides information that is targeted to developers and often unnecessary for other interested parties. However, in both presentation and development mode, there is a toggle to switch between both modes.

  More information: [The UI / Presentation vs Development mode](/docs/the-ui/presentation-vs-dev-mode.md)

- **The HTML and accessibility validations have been removed.**

  You can run tools like this in your command line or CI, so _miyagi_ can be less cluttered.

- **The search now only shows the result**, hiding all other entries in the menu, which makes it easier to navigate.

- **The UI nows shows resolved mock data** and it uses a file tree for both mock data and schema.

- The design of _miyagi_ got slighty revised.

## Configuration

- **Theming _miyagi_ got revised.**

  Instead of passing lots of configuration options, you can now make use of the CSS custom properties _miyagi_ uses internally.
  Also, the `config.ui.theme` definition changed slightly.

  More information: [How-to / Theming the UI](docs/how-to/theming-the-ui.md)

- **You can now pass an `AJV` import to _miyagi_ if you want to use a specific JSON schema version.**

  More information: [How-to: Configuring the JSON Schema validator](/docs/how-to/configuring-the-json-schema-validator.md)

- **You need to pass your own render method to _miyagi_.**

  Previously, _miyagi_ used `consolidate.js` under the hood. That meant that all rendering engines, that are supported by `consolidate.js` worked out of the box with _miyagi_. That is not longer the case as we removed the dependency to `consolidate.js`. Instead you need to provide a render method via `config.engine.render`. For `twing` e.g. this could look as simple as:

  ```js

  async render({ name, context, cb }) {
  	try {
  		return cb(null, await twing.render(name, context));
  	} catch (err) {
  		return cb(err.toString());
  	}
  }
  ```

  This also means that you neither have to pass `config.engine.name` and `config.engine.options` anymore nor does _miyagi_ try to guess the engine if you do not provide the engine configuration.

- **Component info files are deprecated.**

  There were previously used to define a proper name for the menu. _miyagi_ will now use the component name for the menu.

- **You can now use two different file types for mock files.**

  This can be helpful if you usually want to use e.g. yaml for static mock data, but also need JavaScript to write mock data that is dynamic or needs to be computed in some way.

- **All component variants are now always rendered in an iframe.**

  Previously, having them not rendered inside iframes required _miyagi_ to load your CSS along-side _miyagi_'s CSS which could lead to nasty visual bugs.

  This also means that `config.components.renderInIframe` has been removed.

## JavaScript API

### New methods

- **`createBuild()`**
- **`createComponent({ component: String, only?: string[], skip?: string[] })`**
- **`createMockData({ component: String })`**
- **`lintComponent({ component: String })`**
- **`lintComponents()`**

More information: [JavaScript API](/docs/javascript-api.md)

Removed methods:

- `getNode`
  <details>
  	<summary>Alternative approach</summary>
  	If you need the behavior of this method, you could achieve it like this:

      ```
      	import { getHtml } from "@miyagi/core/api";

      	const {
      		success,
      		data: html,
      		message,
      	} = await getHtml({ component, variant });

      	if (success) {
      		const div = document.createElement("div");

      		div.innerHTML = html.trim();

      		if (div.childElementCount > 1) {
      			return div;
      		}

      		return div.firstElementChild;
      	}

      	console.error(message);
      	return null;
      ```

  </details>

## Mock data & schema files

- **Reusable definitions in mock files.**

  You can now create definitions via `$defs` in mock files and reference them in other mock files.

  More information: [How-to / Writing mock data](docs/how-to/writing-mock-data.md#using-definitions)

- **Improved output when the JSON schema validation fails.**

  Previously, _miyagi_ was sometimes a bit unspecific when the given mock data did not match the JSON schema. _miyagi_ now prints the whole error object provided by `AJV`, giving you more information.
  - When creating schema files using the CLI or JS API, they now contain `additionalProperties: false`.

- **Global JSON Schema definitions**

  You can now create global JSON Schema definitions which can be referenced in other JSON Schema files.

  More information: [How-to / Using a global JSON Schema](docs/how-to/using-a-global-json-schema)

## Other

- **You can now add a dedicated documentation section.**

  In this section, you can now create Markdown files with any name. The (formatted) file name will be used for the menu.

- **New verbose mode for easer debugging.**

  The verbose mode can be invoked with `-v` or `--verbose` in case something went wrong. Has not been implemented everywhere yet, so _miyagi_ might not be very verbose in every situation. :-)
