<h2>Start</h2>
<p>To render some markdown based introduction or documentation on the start page, you can put a markdown file <code>README.md</code> in your <a href="/configuration/options#components"><code>components folder</code></a>. Its content is rendered at the very top directly below the <a href="/configuration/options#projectname"><code>project name</code></a>.</p>
<p>The start page also renders an overview of your design tokens, if you configured <em>miyagi</em> to do so. You can read more about that on &quot;<a href="/how-to/creating-a-design-token-overview/">Creating a design token overview</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2>Component</h2>
<p>The <em>component</em> page renders</p>
<ul>
<li>the content of the component's <a href="/component-files/documentation">documentation file</a>,</li>
<li>an info section including the actual component path,</li>
<li>the component's <a href="/component-files/schema">schema</a>, <a href="/component-files/mocks">mock data</a> and <a href="/component-files/template">template</a>,</li>
<li>all variants including the validation status of the mock file as well as the compiled mock data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Component variation</h2>
<p>The <em>variation</em> page renders a single variation of a component, validation status of the mock file as well, the compiled mock data as well as the validation results (see below). You can open it in a new tab, which renders nothing but the component, which is best for development.</p>
