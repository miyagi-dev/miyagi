<p>By default, both the <em>miyagi</em> UI and the components are rendered with a text direction from left to right.</p>
<p>You can set both individually via the configuration options <code>ui.textDirection</code> and <code>components.textDirection</code>.
Both accept the values <code>&quot;ltr&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;rtl&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>The options behave independently of each other, so that, for example, setting <code>ui.textDirection</code> to <code>&quot;rtl&quot;</code> results in the components still being rendered with the text direction from left to right.</p>
