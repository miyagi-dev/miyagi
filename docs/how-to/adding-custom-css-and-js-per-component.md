# Adding custom CSS and JS per component

If you need to add custom CSS or JavaScript to a component to customize in the context of _miyagi_, you can add files inside the component folder for that:

- `<component>.miyagi.css`
- `<component>.miyagi.js`

`<component>` needs to be replaced with the component name.
