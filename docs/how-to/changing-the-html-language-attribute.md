By default, both the _miyagi_ UI and the components use `"en"` for the `lang` attribute.

You can set the language for the components using the `components.lang` configuration option. This sets the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element or on the wrapper of the component.

The `lang` attribute for the _miyagi_ UI cannot currently be changed as only English is supported.
