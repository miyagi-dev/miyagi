## Search

The search can be triggered by pressing <kbd>f</kbd>.

## Go To

By pressing <kbd>g</kbd> you can open a small dialog which allows you to quickly go to a selected component or documentation page.

_**NOTE:** There is one issue in Safari: when you focus an input, select or textarea inside a web component and press <kbd>f</kbd> or <kbd>g</kbd>, the corresponding action is triggered. In other browsers this is prevented._
