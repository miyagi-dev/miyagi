# Using a global JSON Schema

In your component directory (defined via `components.folder`) you can create a global JSON Schema.
The file name needs to be the same as your component JSON Schema files (defined via `files.schema`).

The content of the file needs to be an array of JSON schema definitions. That allows you to define multiple global JSON Schema definitions.
