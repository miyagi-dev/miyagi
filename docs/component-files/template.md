**File:** `index.<template extension>`

If the template files should have the same name as their component folder, you can [define that in the config](/configuration/options#templates).

Since _miyagi_ uses [consolidate.js](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js), it supports a lot of template engines out of the box. Please have a look at the [supported template engines](/template-engines).
